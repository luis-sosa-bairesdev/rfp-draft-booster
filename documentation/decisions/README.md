# Technical Decision Records

This directory contains Technical Decision Records (TDRs) documenting important technical decisions made during the project.

## Format

Each decision should be documented using the `document-template.mc` and include:

- Context: What is the issue we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
- Decision: What is the change that we're actually proposing or doing?
- Consequences: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
- Alternatives Considered: What other options were evaluated?

## Naming Convention

Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD-decision-title.md`

Example: `2025-11-07-llm-provider-selection.md`

## Creating New Documents

Use the `document-template.mc` when creating new decision records.
