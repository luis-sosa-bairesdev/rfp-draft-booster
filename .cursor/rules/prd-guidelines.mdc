# PRD Guidelines

## Overview

Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) serve as the single source of truth for product features and functionality. They bridge the gap between business objectives and technical implementation.

## Core Rules (Must Follow)

- Always create **one .md document per PRD or User Story** in `/deliverables`
- **Do not group** multiple user stories or PRDs in a single file
- Always use the PRD template from `.cursor/rules/templates/prd_template.md`
- If updating a document, **must change document version**
- Before finishing, **reflect on PRD content** and ensure completeness
- Always use `@context.md` (now `context/context.md`) before defining a product requirement

## PRD Finalization Checklist

Before finalizing and distributing, ensure:
- [ ] All sections are fully completed, clear, and explicitly detailed
- [ ] All ambiguities have been resolved or explicitly noted for clarification
- [ ] The PRD has a document version number
- [ ] Related domain entities have been updated
- [ ] All required sections from template are present

## Writing Standards

### Language & Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (define when used)
- Write in active voice
- Be specific and measurable
- Use present tense for current state, future tense for planned features

### Formatting
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use tables for comparative data
- Include diagrams and flowcharts where helpful

### Examples
Always include concrete examples:
```markdown
**User Story Example:**
As a sales manager, I want to upload RFP PDFs and get automated draft responses, so that I can respond to 3x more RFPs per week.

**Acceptance Criteria Example:**
- User can upload PDF files up to 50MB
- System extracts requirements within 30 seconds
- Draft response is generated in under 2 minutes
```

## Requirement Specification

### Functional Requirements Format
```markdown
**FR-001: PDF Upload**
- **Priority:** Must-have
- **Description:** Users can upload RFP documents in PDF format
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Supports PDF files up to 50MB
  - Validates file format before processing
  - Shows upload progress indicator
  - Displays error for invalid files
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Estimated Effort:** 5 story points
```

### User Stories Format
Follow this template:
```markdown
As a [user type],
I want to [action],
So that [benefit/goal].
```

### Acceptance Criteria
Use Given-When-Then format when appropriate:
```markdown
Given [context/precondition]
When [action/event]
Then [expected outcome]
```

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing a PRD, verify:

- [ ] All required sections are complete
- [ ] Problem statement is clear and validated
- [ ] Solution addresses the problem effectively
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable and realistic
- [ ] Functional requirements have acceptance criteria
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and documented
- [ ] Risks are assessed with mitigation plans
- [ ] Timeline is realistic and achievable
- [ ] Stakeholders have reviewed and approved
- [ ] Document follows naming conventions
- [ ] Links and references are valid
- [ ] Version history is maintained

## Collaboration

### Review Process
1. **Draft:** Author creates initial version
2. **Review:** Stakeholders provide feedback
3. **Revision:** Author incorporates feedback
4. **Approval:** Final sign-off from stakeholders
5. **Publication:** Share with development team

### Feedback Guidelines
- Be specific and constructive
- Reference section and line numbers
- Suggest alternatives when possible
- Focus on clarity and completeness
- Validate assumptions and requirements

## Maintenance

### Version Control
- Use semantic versioning (1.0, 1.1, 2.0)
- Document changes in version history
- Archive previous versions
- Update "Last Modified" date

### Updates
- Review quarterly or when major changes occur
- Keep aligned with implementation reality
- Update based on user feedback
- Document lessons learned
